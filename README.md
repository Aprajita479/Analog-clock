# Analog Clock

This is a simple analog clock program built using the pygame library in Python. The program displays a graphical representation of an analog clock on the screen, with the current time.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pygame library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the pygame library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries:
   ```python
   import pygame
   from math import pi, cos, sin
   import datetime
   ```

2. Set the width and height of the screen:
   ```python
   WIDTH, HEIGHT = 1920, 1080
   ```

3. Initialize pygame and set the screen size:
   ```python
   pygame.init()
   screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
   pygame.display.set_caption("Analog Clock")
   ```

4. Define the colors to be used:
   ```python
   WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
   BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
   RED = (255, 0, 0)
   ```

5. Define helper functions for drawing the clock numbers and converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates:
   ```python
   def numbers(number, size, position):
       # Function to draw clock numbers
       pass

   def polar_to_cartesian(r, theta):
       # Function to convert polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates
       pass
   ```

6. Define the main function that will handle the clock logic and drawing:
   ```python
   def main():
       # Main function for the clock program
       pass
   ```

7. Inside the main function, create a game loop that will continuously update the clock display:
   ```python
   run = True
   while run:
       # Game loop
       pass
   ```

8. Handle the events inside the game loop, such as quitting the program:
   ```python
   for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
           run = False
   ```

9. Get the current time using the datetime module:
   ```python
   current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
   second = current_time.second
   minute = current_time.minute
   hour = current_time.hour
   ```

10. Draw the clock face and numbers on the screen:
    ```python
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, WHITE, center, clock_radius - 10, 10)
    # Draw other clock elements
    ```

11. Update the display and control the frame rate:
    ```python
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(FPS)
    ```

12. Call the main function to start the clock program:
    ```python
    main()
    ```

## Customization

You can customize the clock appearance by modifying the code inside the main function. You can change the colors, sizes, positions, and other visual elements to suit your preferences.

Feel free to experiment and have fun with the code!
